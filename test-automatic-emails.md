# 📧 AUTOMATIC EMAIL TESTING GUIDE

## ✅ AUTOMATIC EMAIL FUNCTIONALITY IS NOW ACTIVE

The automatic email sending to your office has been **enabled and fixed**. Here's how to test it:

## 🧪 TESTING STEPS

### **Step 1: Complete a Stop as Driver**
1. **Login as a driver** (e.g., Driver's Name / Driver's Name123)
2. **Go to driver dashboard** → View available stops
3. **Select a stop** and go through the completion process:
   - Mark as "Go" → "Arrived" → "Complete Delivery"
   - Upload any images if needed
   - Add driver notes if needed
   - **Mark as COMPLETED**

### **Step 2: Check Server Logs**
After completing a stop, check PM2 logs for automatic email activity:

```bash
pm2 logs br-driver-app -f
```

**Look for these log messages:**
```
📧 Sending automatic delivery confirmation to office for: [Customer Name]
✅ Automatic delivery confirmation email sent to office for: [Customer Name]
📧 Message ID: <message-id@gmail.com>
```

### **Step 3: Check Your Office Email**
1. **Check:** `infobrfood@gmail.com`
2. **Look for:** New delivery confirmation email
3. **Subject:** `Delivery Completed - [Customer Name] - Order [Order Number]`
4. **Attachment:** Professional PDF with delivery details

## 🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED

### **Before (Not Working):**
- ❌ Required customer to have email address
- ❌ Would skip sending if customer.email was empty
- ❌ Limited automatic email functionality

### **After (Now Working):**
- ✅ **Sends to office for ALL completed deliveries**
- ✅ **No customer email required**
- ✅ **Automatic sending on every stop completion**
- ✅ **Detailed logging for debugging**
- ✅ **Error handling that doesn't break stop completion**

## 📧 EMAIL DETAILS

**Recipient:** `infobrfood@gmail.com` (your office)
**Sender:** `infobrfood@gmail.com` (your Gmail account)
**Subject:** `Delivery Completed - [Customer Name] - Order [Order Number]`
**Content:** Simple black & white professional email
**Attachment:** PDF with delivery confirmation details

## 🔍 DEBUGGING

### **If No Email Received:**

1. **Check PM2 logs:**
   ```bash
   pm2 logs br-driver-app | grep -i email
   ```

2. **Look for error messages:**
   - SMTP authentication errors
   - PDF generation errors
   - Network connectivity issues

3. **Check Gmail SMTP settings:**
   ```bash
   node check-env-config.js
   ```

4. **Test SMTP directly:**
   ```bash
   node test-gmail-smtp.js
   ```

### **Expected Log Flow:**
```
