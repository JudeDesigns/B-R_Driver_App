## Technical Specification Document

---

**Project Name:** B&R Document Management System (DMS)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Prepared By:** Development Team  
**Document Type:** Technical Specification  
**Status:** Proposal  

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Project Overview
The B&R Document Management System (DMS) is a standalone application designed to automatically collect, organize, and manage all business documents generated by the existing B&R Driver App. This system will provide centralized document storage, advanced search capabilities, and automated workflow management for invoice processing and delivery documentation.

### Business Problem
Currently, the B&R Driver App accumulates signed invoices, delivery photos, and other documents that:
- Consume increasing server storage space
- Lack organized retrieval mechanisms
- Have no long-term archival strategy
- Require manual management for business operations
- Cannot be efficiently searched or analyzed

### Proposed Solution
A dedicated Document Management System that:
- **Automatically imports** documents from the driver app via scheduled scripts
- **Organizes files** by date, route, customer, and document type
- **Provides advanced search** capabilities for instant document retrieval
- **Maintains audit trails** for compliance and business intelligence
- **Manages storage lifecycle** with automated cleanup policies
- **Offers role-based access** for administrative users

### Expected Benefits
- **90% reduction** in document retrieval time
- **Automated workflow** eliminating manual file management
- **Improved compliance** with complete audit trails
- **Enhanced customer service** through instant document access
- **Reduced storage costs** on primary operational systems
- **Business intelligence** through document analytics

## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### High-Level Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **B&R Driver App (Source System)**
   - Document generation and temporary storage
   - Driver mobile interface for document capture
   - File upload system (/public/uploads/)
   - PostgreSQL database with delivery metadata
   - 7-day retention policy for transferred files

2. **Import Scripts (Automated Transfer)**
   - Daily import script (scheduled via cron)
   - Database connection to extract metadata
   - File transfer and validation system
   - Error handling and logging mechanisms
   - Cleanup automation for source files

3. **Document Management System (Target System)**
   - Next.js web application
   - PostgreSQL database for document metadata
   - Hierarchical file storage system
   - Search and analytics engine
   - User authentication and authorization

### Component Integration
The B&R Driver App generates documents during daily operations. Each night at 11:59 PM, automated import scripts extract completed delivery data, transfer associated documents to the DMS with proper organization, and clean up old files from the source system after 7 days.

## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Automated Import System

**Daily Import Process:**
- **Schedule:** Every night at 11:59 PM
- **Source Data:** Previous day's completed deliveries
- **Process Flow:**
  1. Connect to B&R Driver App database
  2. Query completed stops with documents
  3. Extract metadata (route, customer, driver, timestamps)
  4. Transfer files with organized naming convention
  5. Validate file integrity (checksums)
  6. Update import logs
  7. Generate daily import report

**File Organization Structure:**
```
/storage/
├── YYYY/ (Year)
│   ├── MM-MonthName/ (Month)
│   │   ├── DD/ (Day)
│   │   │   ├── Route-XXX/ (Route Number)
│   │   │   │   ├── signed-invoices/
