- Updated driver dashboard to use PST timezone for date calculation
- Fixed assigned routes API to use PST timezone for filtering
- Fixed driver stops API to use PST timezone for filtering  
- Fixed driver routes API to use PST timezone for filtering
- Drivers will now see today's routes instead of yesterday's routes
- All driver-side date filtering now uses PST timezone consistently"
